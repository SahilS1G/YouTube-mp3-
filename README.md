# YouTube-mp3-
</br>
You can now download your favourite songs from youtube in mp3 format
</br>
But before downloading any songs you need to edit the Path variable (that is the location where you want to store all of your mp3 files) insde the audio.py file
</br>
If you are running linux you can just copy paste the path whare you want to store all of your mp3 files
</br>
But if you are running windows you need to add an extra "\" after every backslash
</br>
For example :
</br>
If you want to store all of your mp3 files in "C:\User\music"
</br>
then you will have to write it as "C:\\User\\music"
</br>

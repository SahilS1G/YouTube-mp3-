# YouTube-mp3-
You can now download your favourite songs from youtube in mp3 format
</br>
But before downloading any songs you need to edit the Path variable (that is the location where you want to store all of your mp3 files) insde the audio.py file
If you are running linux you can just copy paste the path whare you want to store all of your mp3 files
But if you are running windows you need to add an extra "\" after every backslash
For example :
If you want to store all of your mp3 files in "C:\User\music"
then you will have to write it as "C:\\User\\music"
